DFD



A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of how data flows through a system or process. It shows the inputs, processes, data storage, and outputs of a system or process, as well as how data moves between these components. Here's a textual representation of a high-level DFD for a simplified employee management system that includes the tables you've created:

Level 0 DFD: Employee Management System

Processes:

Manage Employees: This process represents the overall management of employee data.
Generate Salary Overview: This process generates salary overviews for employees.
Generate Invoices: This process generates invoices for employees.
Manage Admins: This process represents the management of admin user data.
Data Stores:

Employees List: Stores employee data (employeesid, username, email, etc.).
Salary Overview: Stores salary overview data.
Invoices: Stores invoice data.
Admin Lists: Stores admin user data.
External Entities:

Admin User: Represents the administrators who interact with the system.
Employees: Represents the employees who interact with the system.
Data Flows:

Employee Data: Data flow from Employees to Manage Employees process.
Admin User Data: Data flow from Admin User to Manage Admins process.
Generate Salary Overview Data: Data flow from Manage Employees to Generate Salary Overview process.
Salary Overview Data: Data flow from Generate Salary Overview process to Salary Overview data store.
Generate Invoice Data: Data flow from Manage Employees to Generate Invoices process.
Invoice Data: Data flow from Generate Invoices process to Invoices data store.
This is a high-level DFD that illustrates the major components of your employee management system. Depending on your specific requirements, you can create more detailed DFDs at lower levels to further decompose processes and data flows within the system. These lower-level DFDs would provide more detail about the internal processes of each major process shown in the Level 0 DFD.
